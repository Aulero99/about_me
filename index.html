<h1>Hello is this thing on?</h1>

<p>This is a bit about me. I like üç™. However, I am allergic to üßÄ. Just a test of the live update features.</p>

<p>This is a simple list of things I like</p>
<ul>
    <li>Magic the Gathering</li>
    <li>Pokemon Video Games</li>
    <li>Snowboarding</li>
    <li>Design/Art/Detail-Oriented Tasks</li>
    <li>Sweet Foods</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a simple list of things I don't like</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sunburn</li>
    <li>Celery</li>
    <li>Indian Food</li>
    <li>Pokemon TCG</li>
    <li>First Person Shooters</li>
</ul>

<p>In my free time I like to watch anime or youtube videos. My favorite anime of all time by view count is Overlord, but my favorite one to sit down and enjoy is either Eighty Six or Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood with season 1 of Psycho Pass coming in at a close third. My favorite youtube channel is Linus Tech Tips, but I also enjoy watching speed runs on GDQ or some nonsense clay sculpting by North of the Border, that guy is hilarious and his cursed Minion video made me laugh so hard I nearly choked on a granola bar.</p>
